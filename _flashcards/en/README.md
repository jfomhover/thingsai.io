# English Memos

Place English memo summaries in this directory.

Memos are concise, one-pager summaries of best practices or key knowledge on a specific topic. They distill material from `context/knowledge/` into reusable, well-formatted reference pages.

Files should be named: `topic-name.md`

Each memo should include front matter:
```yaml
---
layout: flashcard
title: "Memo Title"
subtitle: "Optional subtitle for context"
lang: en
date: 2026-01-22
topic: topic-name  # e.g., resume-writing, ai-agents, career
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

## Guidelines

- **One-pager**: Keep content concise and focused on key points
- **High signal**: Include only essential, actionable information
- **Well-formatted**: Use clear headings, bullet points, and visual hierarchy
- **Easy to link**: Structure for easy cross-linking from blog posts and essays
- **Reference quality**: Content should serve as a quick reference guide
