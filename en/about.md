# Background

Born and raised in France, I spent over a decade in French academia as an Associate Professor at Arts et Métiers ParisTech, one of France's prestigious Grandes Écoles for engineering. My academic work focused on applying machine learning to industrial design and manufacturing challenges, bridging theoretical research with practical applications.

In 2016, I made the leap from academia to industry and relocated to Seattle to join Galvanize as an instructor and curriculum designer. This transition allowed me to combine my passion for teaching with hands-on industry experience, preparing aspiring data scientists for real-world challenges.

Since 2017, I've been at Microsoft, where I've evolved from Senior Data Scientist to Principal Product Manager. This journey has given me a unique perspective that spans academic research, hands-on data science, people leadership, and product strategy—allowing me to bridge technical depth with business impact.

# Beyond Work

Outside of my professional life, I'm a father, maker, and lifelong learner. I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of AI, knowledge work, and human creativity. I believe in the power of AI agents to augment human capabilities while respecting individual agency and privacy.

I enjoy writing about AI systems, career development, and the evolving landscape of technology. This website serves as a platform to share my thoughts, showcase projects, and connect with others who are equally passionate about the future of AI.
